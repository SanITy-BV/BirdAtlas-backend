What does a backend developer need to know for setting up a modern, high quality API on Azure for your frontend apps. 

This repository is the basis for an inspirational half-day workshop breaking down the process of creating an enterprise-quality API in different parts focusing on implementation, security and hosting principles. Different application architectures are out of scope and can be handled in a separate workshop.

More info on the implemented steps from this workshop can be found in this [blog post](https://bartlannoeye.com/blog/series-enterprise-quality-api/). Also don't hesitate to contact us on Twitter for extra topics or more deep dive content handled during a full-day workshop.
